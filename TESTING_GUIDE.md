     ```javascript
     let reviews = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('product_reviews'));
     reviews[0].approved = true;
     localStorage.setItem('product_reviews', JSON.stringify(reviews));
     ```
   - Refresh page → click Reviews tab
   - Should now see your review displayed!

6. **Test Multiple Reviews**:
   - Submit 2-3 more reviews with different ratings
   - Approve them using console method above
   - Check that average rating updates

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Search Not Working
**Problem**: Search button does nothing
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure `script.js` is loaded
- Verify `shopify-products-data` JSON exists on page

### Reviews Not Saving
**Problem**: Review form submits but doesn't save
**Solution**:
- Check if localStorage is enabled in browser
- Try in regular browser window (not incognito initially)
- Check console for JavaScript errors

### Stars Not Clickable
**Problem**: Can't click stars in review form
**Solution**:
- Make sure Font Awesome is loaded (check network tab)

## 🔄 How Reviews Work (For Future Reference)

### Current Implementation
- **Storage**: Browser `localStorage` (temporary)
- **Moderation**: Manual (set `approved: true` in console)
- **Display**: Only approved reviews show to customers

### Migration Path for Production

When ready for production, you'll need to:

1. **Set up backend** (choose one):
   - Firebase/Firestore (easiest)
   - Supabase (free tier available)
   - Custom API (Node.js/PHP)
   - Shopify app (Yotpo, Judge.me, etc.)

2. **Update JavaScript**:
   - Replace `localStorage` calls with API calls
   - Add admin authentication
   - Create moderation dashboard

3. **Current code is ready** for this migration:
   - Review data structure is production-ready
   - Form validation in place
   - UI components complete
   - Just need to swap storage layer
